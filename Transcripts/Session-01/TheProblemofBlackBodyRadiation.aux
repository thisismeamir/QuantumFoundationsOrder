B is immersed in a bath of nitre and its temperature could be varied between 200 C and 600 C. Above that temperature an iron cylinder was heated to 1300 C by a gas furnace. G was a Lummer-Kurlbaum bolometer. To measure the spectrum of the radiation, the radiation from B was passed first through a fluor-spar prism and the spectral energy distribution measured by a linear bolometer.}}}{3}{}\protected@file@percent }
